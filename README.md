Netflix Clone (HTML & CSS)

This repository contains a Netflix clone, solely designed using HTML and CSS. It's an exercise in frontend development, aiming to capture the look and feel of Netflix's user interface without the use of JavaScript or any frameworks.

Features :

Responsive design mimicking the original Netflix interface.
Showcase of popular Netflix titles.
Hover animations for a more interactive feel.

Limitations :

This clone is static and only for visual purposes. Functionalities like playing videos or user authentication are not implemented.
As it's made purely with HTML and CSS, dynamic features from the original Netflix, like carousel sliders, are not present.
